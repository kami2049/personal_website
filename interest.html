	<h1>Here are a few of my favorite things:</h1>
	<section class="tech">
		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>The things we have created with technology is amazing, but of course you can't have good without the bad. What interest me the most is the brillant minds behind the technology. I just wish i could jump into their brains just to see what their thought process was.</p>

	<section class="games">
		<h3>Where my gamers at ?</h3>
		<p>I guess you can say i'm a big kid. I'm cool with that because i refuse to give up video games. It really annoys me when people say adults should't play games.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Playstation 4</li>
			<li>First-person shooter</li>
			<li>Zombies</li>
		</ul>

	<section class="anime">
		<h3>I love Anime</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>DragonBall Z</li>
			<li>Sailor Moon</li>
			<li>Cowboy Bebop</li>
			<li>Attack on Titan</li>
			<li>Gun Grave</li>
		</ul>

	<section class="finance">
		<h3>Money Matters</h3>
		<p>After finishing High School and doing adult things, i always wondered why money wasn't a subject. I like to listen to business news, read or surf the net for information about money. This green piece of paper causes so much change, good and bad.</p>
