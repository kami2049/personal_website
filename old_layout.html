			Hello World!", my name is Kamilah Hamilton a.k.a Kami. My love for technology started when i was in middle school after i seen my uncle build his own computer. I thought it was the coolest thing in the world. The tower was clear so you could see right thru it to the motherboard and it lit up with lights. I have tested the waters with taking apart computers, solving software issues, networking technologies, running servers, penetration testing and coding. My journey has led me to the NYCDA web developer intensive course.Here i will see if i can turn this hobby of mines into a career.
